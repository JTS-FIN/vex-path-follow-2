# Vex IQ - Path follow (RobotC) ver. 2

Made a "self driving car" with Vex IQ robotics. In this implementation, the code tries to stay on top of the path as well as possible and follow the planned path that way. So when it gets out of the path, it will stop and seek where it continues and go on from there. Video will explain it much better than I can do, so please check it out below.
